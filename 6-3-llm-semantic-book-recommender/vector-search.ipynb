    "Before diving into building our vector search, let's explore  present our envirement with our first framework: the **LangChain framework**, which simplifies the development of applications using large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is an open-source Python framework designed to facilitate the creation of applications powered by LLMs. It provides modular components that enable developers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and process documents.\n",
    "- Split text into manageable chunks.\n",
    "- Generate embeddings using various models.\n",
    "- Store and retrieve embeddings efficiently using vector databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain's architecture comprises several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Loaders**: Tools to load documents from various sources.  \n",
    "- **Text Splitters**: Utilities to divide large documents into smaller chunks.  \n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Methods to convert text into vector representations.  \n",
    "- **Vector Stores**: Databases to store and retrieve embeddings.  \n",
    "- **Chains**: Sequences of operations that process data.  \n",
    "- **Agents**: Systems that use LLMs to decide the control flow of an application.  \n",
    "- **Memory**: Mechanisms to maintain state across interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components can be combined to build complex workflows for tasks like semantic search, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖼 LangChain Architecture Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./langchain.png\">  \n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the hierarchical organization of the LangChain framework, showing how its components interact across multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Similar Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "Other frameworks offer similar functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Modular framework for scalable, visualized, big data ML workflows.  \n",
    "- **LlamaIndex**: Facilitates creation of indices over large datasets for efficient retrieval.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These alternatives may be better suited for specific project requirements, but LangChain provides a comprehensive, modular approach for LLM-based applications.\n",

    "## - Understanding Chroma and Vector Databases \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform semantic search, we need a **vector database**. In our project, we use **Chroma**, which integrates seamlessly with LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is Chroma?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma is an open-source **vector database** designed to store and query embeddings efficiently.  \n",
    "It allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persist embeddings and metadata (like book titles and categories).  \n",
    "- Retrieve the most similar embeddings quickly using similarity search.  \n",
    "- Integrate easily with language models via frameworks like LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector database** is a database that stores **vector embeddings**—numerical representations of data (text, images, audio, etc.)—instead of traditional structured data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each piece of data is converted into a high-dimensional vector using an embedding model (e.g., HuggingFace or OpenAI).  \n",
    "- Similarity between items is measured by comparing their vectors, often using **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Does a Vector Database Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Generation**:  \n",
    "   Text data (like book descriptions) is converted into vector embeddings. Each embedding is a list of numbers representing the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Storage**:  \n",
    "   Vectors are stored in the vector database along with metadata, e.g., title, category, or author.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Querying / Similarity Search**:  \n",
    "   - When a user submits a query, it is also converted into a vector.  \n",
    "   - The database calculates similarity scores between the query vector and all stored vectors.  \n",
    "   - The most similar items are returned as results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ranking**:  \n",
    "   Results are ranked by similarity score, giving the user the most relevant recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./vectordatabase (1).png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Use a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional databases cannot efficiently perform **semantic search**.  \n",
    "- Vector databases are optimized for **high-dimensional vector operations**, enabling real-time, context-aware search.  \n",
    "- They are essential for modern recommender systems, AI search engines, and any application using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation prepares the user to understand **why we use Chroma with LangChain** and how semantic search works under the hood.\n"

    "## 6 - Text Chunking with Sliding Window <a id=\"6\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When preparing text for embeddings, it's important to split large documents into smaller chunks. This allows the embedding model to handle the text efficiently while preserving semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is Chunking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking divides a large text into smaller, manageable segments called **chunks**. Each chunk can then be embedded separately, making semantic search feasible for long texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Sliding Window Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sliding window** is a technique where a fixed-size window moves across the text, creating overlapping chunks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Window Size (Chunk Size)**: Number of characters or tokens per chunk.  \n",
    "- **Overlap**: Number of characters or tokens shared between consecutive chunks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example with `chunk_size = 500` and `chunk_overlap = 50`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunk 1 → characters 0–499  \n",
    "- Chunk 2 → characters 450–949  \n",
    "- Chunk 3 → characters 900–1399  \n",
    "\n",
    "This overlap ensures **context is preserved** across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Use Sliding Window?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preserves context at chunk boundaries.  \n",
    "- Improves retrieval accuracy for semantic search.  \n",
    "- Balances efficiency and meaningful embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Choosing Chunk Size and Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Size**:\n",
    "  - Should fit within your embedding model's input limit.  \n",
    "  - Large enough to contain meaningful context, small enough for efficiency.  \n",
    "  - Typical: 200–1000 characters (we use 500).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap**:\n",
    "  - Preserves context between chunks.  \n",
    "  - Typical: 10–20% of chunk size (we use 50, i.e., 10% of 500).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule of Thumb**: Start with a chunk size roughly equal to paragraph length and 10–20% overlap, then adjust based on search performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖼 Visual Example\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sliding Window Chunking](https://bitpeak.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sliding-Window-Chunking-Example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blue boxes = chunks  \n",
    "- Overlap ensures semantic meaning at boundaries is retained  \n",
    "- Adjusting window size and overlap changes number of chunks and retrieval accuracy\n",

       "Document(metadata={'source': 'tagged_description.txt'}, page_content='9780002005883 A NOVEL THAT READERS and critics have been eagerly anticipating for over a decade, Gilead is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives. John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.')"

    "## 7 - Understanding Text Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "To build a semantic search system, the core concept is **text embeddings**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is a Text Embedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **text embedding** is a **numerical vector** that represents the semantic meaning of a piece of text.  \n",
    "- Instead of just comparing keywords, embeddings capture **context and meaning**, so similar concepts are close together in a high-dimensional space.  \n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "  - “A thrilling detective story”  \n",
    "  - “A suspenseful mystery novel”  \n",
    "  → These two sentences will have embeddings that are close in vector space, even if the words differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Use Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable **semantic search**: find text based on meaning, not exact words.  \n",
    "- Support **recommendation systems**: similar books or documents can be retrieved easily.  \n",
    "- Useful for **clustering and classification** tasks in NLP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Choosing an Embedding Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HuggingFace Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Open-source models, run locally or on your server.  \n",
    "   - Example: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  \n",
    "     - Lightweight and fast.  \n",
    "     - Optimized for semantic similarity tasks.  \n",
    "     - HuggingFace link: [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)  \n",
    "   - To choose a model:\n",
    "     - Check task: semantic search, classification, clustering.  \n",
    "     - Consider speed vs accuracy trade-off: smaller models → faster, larger models → more precise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OpenAI Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Cloud-based API embeddings, e.g., `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large`.  \n",
    "   - High-quality embeddings suitable for production-scale semantic search.  \n",
    "   - Example link: [OpenAI Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Other Options**:\n",
    "   - Train custom embeddings with PyTorch or TensorFlow.  \n",
    "   - Use domain-specific pre-trained models if your data is specialized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 How Embeddings Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- The embedding model converts each text chunk into a **vector of numbers**.  \n",
    "- **Distance or similarity** between vectors (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) measures semantic closeness.  \n",
    "- This allows the vector database to **find the most relevant documents** for a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embeddings are the foundation of semantic search and recommendation systems.  \n",
    "- Model choice depends on **accuracy requirements**, **speed**, and **deployment constraints**.  \n",
    "- HuggingFace models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` are a great starting point for most semantic search tasks.\n",

    "### 🔹 What is Retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval** refers to the process of searching a dataset or database to find items that are **most relevant** to a given query.  \n",
    "- In the context of semantic search:\n",
    "  - Each document (or chunk) is converted into a **vector embedding**.\n",
    "  - A query is also converted into a **vector embedding**.\n",
    "  - The system finds documents whose vectors are **closest to the query vector** using similarity measures like **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval ensures that you can **access relevant knowledge** efficiently without scanning the entire dataset manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG** combines **retrieval** and **generation**:\n",
    "  1. **Retrieve**: Find relevant documents or knowledge pieces from a vector database.  \n",
    "  2. **Augment**: Feed the retrieved documents as context to a **language model**.  \n",
    "  3. **Generate**: The language model produces a **response or answer** using the retrieved information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example use cases:\n",
    "  - Answering questions using company documentation.\n",
    "  - Providing book recommendations with generated summaries.\n",
    "  - Chatbots that respond with accurate knowledge from large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 How Semantic Search Fits In\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `retrieve_semantic_recommendations` function we implemented:\n",
    "  - Converts the user's query into a vector.\n",
    "  - Retrieves the **most semantically similar book chunks**.\n",
    "  - Returns relevant books from the database.\n",
    "-  This is **retrieval**.\n",
    "-  It is **not full RAG**, because:\n",
    "  - There is **no language model generating new text**.\n",
    "  - The output is only filtered **existing data** (books), not generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval is the **first step in RAG systems**.  \n",
    "- Vector embeddings + similarity search allow **context-aware retrieval**.  \n",
    "- RAG enhances retrieval by **feeding retrieved context into a generative model** to produce informative, natural language answers.  \n"

    "## 10 - Understanding the Vector Database Storage <a id=\"10\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Vector Databases Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **vector database** (like Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) stores **vector embeddings** instead of traditional rows of text.  \n",
    "- Each entry typically contains:\n",
    "  1. The **embedding vector** (numerical representation of the text).  \n",
    "  2. Optional **metadata** (like ISBN, title, author).  \n",
    "  3. Optionally, the **original text chunk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you query the database:\n",
    "  - The query is converted into a vector.\n",
    "  - The database finds the **closest vectors** using similarity measures like **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "  - Returns the associated metadata or original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Where is the Data Stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-memory**: Some vector databases can run fully in memory for fast access (Chroma can do this).  \n",
    "- **On-disk**: Others store data on disk for persistence (Chroma, FAISS with disk-backed index).  \n",
    "- **Cloud storage**: Managed services like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus store vectors in the cloud.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the case of **Chroma**:\n",
    "  - By default, it stores data locally in a folder named `chroma_db` (or a path you specify).  \n",
    "  - This folder contains all embeddings, metadata, and collection info.\n",
    "  - You can **inspect this folder**, but the data is typically in a serialized format, not human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Can You See the Stored Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directly browsing**: You can see some metadata in JSON or SQLite-like files if Chroma is configured with a persistent directory.  \n",
    "- **Programmatically**: Use Chroma API methods to query the database and inspect embeddings or metadata. Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  db_books.get()\n"
