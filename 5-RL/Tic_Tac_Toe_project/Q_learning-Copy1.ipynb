    "\n",

    "   - Implement a simple text-based or GUI interface.  \n",
    "   - Try playing against your trained agent. Can you beat it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement SARSA**  \n",
    "   - Replace the Q-learning update with the SARSA update:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Q(s,a) \\gets Q(s,a) + \\alpha \\Big[ r + \\gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) \\Big]\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "   - Compare results with Q-Learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a Deep Q-Network (DQN)**  \n",
    "   - Replace the Q-table with a neural network.  \n",
    "   - Train it using the same environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Experiment with Exploration**  \n",
    "   - Try different exploration strategies (e.g., decaying $\\epsilon$, softmax).  \n",
    "   - Observe how agent behavior changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deployment Idea 💡**  \n",
    "   - Wrap your trained agent in an API.  \n",
    "   - Build a small GUI so humans can play against it.  \n"
